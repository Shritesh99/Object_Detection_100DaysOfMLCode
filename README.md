# Object Detection

### This Repository is a part of [100DaysofMLCode challenge](https://github.com/Shritesh99/100DaysofMLCodeChallenge)

In this project, we will be deploying a convolutional neural network (CNN) for object recognition. More specifically, we will be using the All-CNN network published in the 2015 ICLR paper, "Striving For Simplicity: The All Convolutional Net". This paper can be found at the following link:

This convolutional neural network obtained state-of-the-art performance at object recognition on the CIFAR-10 image dataset in 2015. We will build this model using Keras, a high-level neural network application programming interface (API) that supports both Theano and Tensorflow backends.
